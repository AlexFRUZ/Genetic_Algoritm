# Golf Course Layout Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

Hello Friend! This file contains a detailed description of the program.

This Python code implements a genetic algorithm to optimize the layout of a golf course graph. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. **Import Statements**
    - The code begins with importing necessary modules and libraries, including:
        - PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI)
        - networkx for graph operations
        - matplotlib for plotting graphs
        - Other standard libraries for mathematical computations

2. **Constants**
    - Several constants are defined at the beginning of the script, including:
        - `population_size`
        - `generations`
        - `mutation_rate`
        - `elite_size`

3. **GeneticAlgorithmApp Class**
    - This class inherits from `QMainWindow` and represents the main application window.
    - It contains methods to set up the GUI elements such as buttons, spin boxes, line edits, labels, text edit fields, and the graphics view for displaying the graph.

4. **Graph Setup and Display**
    - The `setup_graph` method creates a random graph representing a golf course layout.
    - The `display_graph` method visualizes the graph using matplotlib and adds it to the QGraphicsScene.

5. **Genetic Algorithm Execution**
    - The `run_genetic_algorithm` method initiates the genetic algorithm process.
    - It validates user inputs, such as start and end vertices, and calls the internal algorithm execution method `run_genetic_algorithm_internal`.

6. **Genetic Algorithm Internal Execution**
    - The `run_genetic_algorithm_internal` method implements the core genetic algorithm logic.
    - It generates an initial population, evaluates fitness, selects elite individuals, performs crossover and mutation, and evolves the population over generations.

7. **Fitness Calculation**
    - The `calculate_fitness` function calculates the fitness of an individual solution (path) based on the total length of the path on the golf course graph.

8. **Crossover and Mutation**
    - The `crossover` and `mutate` functions perform crossover and mutation operations on individual paths.

9. **Main Function**
    - The main function initializes the PyQt5 application, creates an instance of the `GeneticAlgorithmApp` class, and runs the application.

Overall, this code implements a GUI application that utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize the layout of a golf course graph by maximizing the length of paths while minimizing the cost.
